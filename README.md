Here’s a step-by-step detailed description of your Flight Price Optimization project:
# Project Description
This project focuses on optimizing airline ticket prices using a machine learning-based dynamic pricing strategy. The primary goal is to maximize revenue for Vistara airline by accurately predicting ticket prices based on key variables and refining those predictions with an objective function that considers market demand.

1. Problem Understanding:
		The project begins with a clear objective to develop a dynamic pricing model for Vistara airline that adjusts ticket prices based on demand and other critical factors such as flight dates, class 		of travel, 			and flight duration. The model aims to provide optimal pricing that maximizes total revenue.

2. Data Collection:
		The dataset used in the project includes several features relevant to flight pricing, including:
		
		Booking Date: Date when the flight was booked.
		Journey Date: Date of the actual flight journey.
		Airline Class: Travel class (Economy, Business, etc.)
		Departure and Arrival Times: Timings of flights.
		Flight Duration: Total time of the flight journey.
		Total Stops: Number of layovers during the flight.
		Ticket Price: The target variable that needs to be predicted and optimized.

3. Data Preprocessing:
		The raw dataset required extensive preprocessing to ensure accurate model predictions. This involved:
		
		Handling missing values: Missing or incomplete data entries were either filled or removed.
		Feature Engineering: Additional features such as the number of days between booking and journey, time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), and weekend vs. weekday flights were generated to enrich 		the dataset.
		Scaling and Encoding: Numerical features were scaled, and categorical variables were encoded to be suitable for machine learning algorithms.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
		Visualizations such as Bar and Histogram charts, Boxplots, and line plots were created to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing prices.

5. Segmentation:
		To tailor pricing strategies to the unique characteristics of each segment and optimize revenue.Both Air India and  Vistara airline offered consistent data patterns and had a significant market 		presence. But 		I chose vistara and economy class as it is more likely to be price sensitive and prioritize affordability( first-class and business-class customers often exhibit a high 		willingness to pay for tickets).

5. Model Selection and Training:
		Several machine learning models were tested to predict ticket prices:

		Random Forest and Decision Tree models were initially explored. While these models provided decent results, they were time-consuming and less effective in terms of accuracy.
		XGBoost Regressor was ultimately chosen for its superior performance and efficiency. It provided the best combination of accuracy and training speed, significantly reducing computational time 		while yielding a 		higher R² score.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
		To further enhance the model's performance, hyperparameter tuning was applied. This involved optimizing key parameters such as:

		Learning Rate
		Number of Estimators
		Maximum Depth
		Subsample Ratio
		I used GridSearchCV for balancing model complexity and generalization, helping the model make more reliable predictions without overfitting to the training data.

7. Price Optimization:
		The next step involved using the trained model to predict ticket prices. However, to ensure the prices were aligned with real-world market conditions, a custom objective function was formulated 		based on 					demand factors. This function considered the current market demand for flights, enabling the model to adjust prices dynamically in response to 			fluctuations in booking patterns.

8. Model EvaluationThe model was evaluated using various performance metrics:

		R² score: 0.8647, indicating that the model explained a large portion of the variance in the ticket prices.
		Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1087.27, demonstrating the model's ability to predict prices with relatively low error.

9. Results and Insights:
		The final model successfully predicted and optimized ticket prices for Vistara airline, contributing to a dynamic pricing strategy that could adapt to changing market conditions. By considering 		demand factors 
    		in the objective function, the project ensured that the prices not only maximized revenue but also responded effectively to customer demand trends.
